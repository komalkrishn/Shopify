### Problems faced during development
+ extracting the client images one by one and create responsive grid for the portfolio
+ For slider section, first used owl carousel then had to integrate using the slick js because owl carousel didnt helped in variable width where we need to show a part of next slide 
+ inegrating the text scroller using pure css was bit tough, finally learnt using css animation and keystrokes
+ lastly hosting in github pages was new for me, learnt this and hosted it successfully
